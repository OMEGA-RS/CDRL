## 📰Overview

**Fig. 1. Flowchart of the proposed CDRL framework.** 🔷Through **CITNet**, a high-quality DI can be obtained by computing the Euclidean distance between paired content features from the translated and target images with the same modality. 🟩Then, reliable samples are generated by segmenting the DI followed by **sample selection**. 🟣Based on knowledge transfer, these samples are fed into the **CDNet** embedded with DIFM to learn the concepts of changed and unchanged pixels, thereby assigning corresponding labels to uncertain samples and producing a final change map.
